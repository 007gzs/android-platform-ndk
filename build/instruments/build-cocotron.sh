PROGRAM_DESCRIPTION=\
"Rebuild Cocotron for the CrystaX NDK.

This requires a temporary NDK installation containing
toolchain binaries for all target architectures.

By default, this will try with the current NDK directory, unless
you use the --ndk-dir=<path> option.

The output will be placed in appropriate sub-directories of
<ndk>/$COCOTRON_SUBDIR, but you can override this with the --out-dir=<path>

option.
