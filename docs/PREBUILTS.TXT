The Android NDK relies on prebuilt platform-specific binaries of the
GCC-based cross-toolchain(s) used to generate ARM binaries.

At the moment, only one toolchain, named "arm-eabi-4.2.1" is supported,
its sources being available in an archive named:

   android-ndk-toolchain-<date>.tar.bz2

XXX: Upload this to a public site like code.google.com/p/android
     Note: this is over 100MB in size.

Prebuilt versions of the toolchain binaries are available for a variety
of supported platforms, and are generally named:

   android-ndk-prebuilt-<date>-<system>.tar.bz2

Where <system> can be one of the following:

   linux-x86
   linux-x86_64
   darwin-x86
   windows

XXX: Upload these prebuilt packages to code.google.com/p/android or
     another similar site. Note: each one is about 30MB in size.

To install them, simply unpack them from the top-level NDK directory.
For example, under 32-bit Linux:

   cd $NDK
   tar xjf android-ndk-prebuilt-20090323-linux-x86.tar.bz2

Otherwise, it is possible to rebuild the toolchain from sources with the
help of the 'build/tools/build-toolchain.sh' script. It can be used to
generate a complete prebuilt package for other platforms.

NOTE: The uncompressed toolchain sources are over 1 GB and make take
      several hours to compile, depending on your machine.

Note that, at the moment, the toolchain binaries are the only Android NDK
files that are platform-specific. The rest being shell scripts and GNU
Makefiles that should be portable to other Unix-like development
environments.
