Android NDK ChangeLog:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
current version

- Fix build/host-setup.sh to:
  * execute as a Bourne shell script
  * remove unused host gcc dependency
  * improve Windows host auto-detection
  * add GNU Make version check
  * ensure that the script is run from $NDKROOT as build/host-setup.sh
  * add --help, --verbose and --no-make-check options

- Properly add sysroot library search path at build time. This makes a line
  in Android.mk like:

     LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz

  Actually work correctly, instead of having the linker complaining that it
  could not find the corresponding libz.so library. Also clear LOCAL_LDLIBS
  in $(CLEAR_VARS) script.

- Generate thumb binaries by default.

- Add support for LOCAL_ARM_MODE in Android.mk.

- Add support for the '.arm' suffix in source file names to force the
  compilation of a single source in arm (32-bit) mode.

- Generate proper unoptimized versions of binaries when APP_OPTIM := debug

- Add support for LOCAL_C_INCLUDES in Android.mk

- Fix compilation of assembler files (e.g. foo.S)

- Make LOCAL_CFLAGS / LOCAL_CXXFLAGS / LOCAL_CPPFLAGS work as advertized
  by the documentation (previously, only LOCAL_CFLAGS did work for both C
  *and* C++ sources, contrary to what the doc claimed).

  Note that APP_CPPFLAGS / APP_CFLAGS / APP_CXXFLAGS continue to work.

android-1.5_r1 released.
