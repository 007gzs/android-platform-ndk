Android NDK ChangeLog:

Last updated 2009-05-29

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current version:

- Expose <android/log.h> containing the stable declarations of liblog.so,
  which can be used to send log messages to the kernel.

- Force the use of 32-bit toolchain binaries on 64-bit hosts. This reduces
  the number of prebuilt packages needed to be distributed.

- Expose the zlib headers <zlib.h> and <zconf.h> as part of the stable
  ABIs.

- Use the --no-undefined flag at link time by default when generating
  binaries. This means that the linker will issue an "undefined symbol"
  error when trying to build a shared library that references an undefined
  variable or function. This is to help catch simple bugs, but you can
  override this by setting LOCAL_ALLOW_UNDEFINED_SYMBOLS to true.

- Fix a typo that prevented APP_CFLAGS, APP_CPPFLAGS, etc.. to work as
  advertized in the build system.

- Fix auto-dependency computations

- Fix dependency between the generated shared libraries and the copy that
  is installed in under the application's project path.

- "make APP=<app> clean" now properly cleans the installed binaries.

- Fix the build-toolchain.sh to refer to the proper download location for the
  toolchain source tarball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
android-1.5_r1 released.
