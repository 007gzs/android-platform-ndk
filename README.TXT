            Android Native Development Kit (NDK)


Welcome, this NDK is designed to allow Android application developers
to include native code in their Android application packages, compiled
as JNI shared libraries.

A high-level overview of the NDK's features and limitations can be found
in docs/OVERVIEW.TXT. Please read this document as it contains crucial
information for correct usage.

Before using the NDK, you will need to follow the steps described by
docs/INSTALL.TXT which lists the NDK pre-requisites and the steps needed
to set it up properly on your machine.

We recommend developers to make themselves familiar with JNI concepts. Also
note that the NDK is *not* a good way to write non-JNI native code for the
Android platform.

The document docs/ROADMAP.TXT gives a tentative roadmap for upcoming
NDK features and improvements.

Finally, discussions related to the Android NDK happen on the public
"android-ndk" forum located at the following address:
